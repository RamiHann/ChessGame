Based on a thorough analysis of the uploaded documents, here is a comprehensive `README.md` file for your chess project, which includes detailed explanations of the features, algorithm implementation, and overall project description:

# Advanced C++ Chess Project

## Project Description
This project is an advanced implementation of chess using C++. It emphasizes the use of object-oriented programming to simulate a detailed chess environment that adheres strictly to the rules of traditional chess, with additional complexities such as move suggestions and advanced game state management.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Using inheritance and polymorphism, each chess piece is an instance of a subclass extending from a common piece class.
- **Exception Handling**: Rigorous exception handling to manage game states and ensure moves are legal according to chess rules.
- **Advanced Move Suggestion**: Implements a move suggestion system using a priority queue that evaluates the best possible moves based on a heuristic.
- **Detailed Game State Management**: Tracks game history for undo functionality and provides comprehensive game state validation to handle scenarios like check, checkmate, and stalemate.
- **Graphical Representation of the Board**: Implements a console-based, visually appealing representation of the chess board using ASCII characters.

## Algorithmic Highlights

- **Move Generation**: Generates all possible moves for a given game state, considering the unique movement patterns of each piece.
- **Move Evaluation**: Evaluates moves based on the board state, prioritizing captures, threats, and strategic positioning.
- **Priority Queue for Move Suggestion**: Uses a custom-built priority queue to manage and sort moves by their evaluated scores, aiding in the move suggestion process. The priority queue is designed using templates to be adaptable for different scoring metrics.
- **Exception-Based Validation**: Employs exceptions to handle and notify of illegal moves or rule violations, ensuring robust game progression.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and compile the project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamiHann/ChessGame.git
cd chess-project
g++ -std=c++17 -o ChessGame *.cpp
./ChessGame

## How to Play

The game is played using standard chess notation input through the command line. Players take turns inputting their moves, which are validated in real-time by the game's engine.
